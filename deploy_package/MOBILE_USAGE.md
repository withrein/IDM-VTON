# IDM-VTON Mobile Interface User Guide

This guide explains how to use the IDM-VTON virtual try-on mobile interface.

## Overview

IDM-VTON is an AI-powered virtual try-on system that allows you to visualize how clothing items would look on you. The mobile interface is specifically designed to work well on smartphones and tablets.

## Accessing the Application

1. Open the URL provided by your administrator (e.g., https://xxx.gradio.app) in your mobile browser
2. The application interface should load and be optimized for your device

## Using the Try-On Feature

### Step 1: Upload Your Photo
- Tap the "Upload your photo" area
- You can either:
  - Choose an existing photo from your device
  - Take a new photo using your camera
- For best results:
  - Use a photo with good lighting
  - Stand against a plain background
  - Ensure your upper body is clearly visible
  - Face the camera directly

### Step 2: Configure Options
- **Auto-mask**: When enabled, automatically detects your body and creates a mask
- **Auto-crop**: When enabled, automatically crops and resizes your image for better results

### Step 3: Upload a Garment Image
- Tap the "Garment Image" area
- Upload a photo of the clothing item you want to try on
- For best results:
  - Use images of garments displayed flat or on a plain background
  - Ensure the garment is well-lit and clearly visible
  - Choose images with minimal distortion

### Step 4: Describe the Garment
- In the "Garment Description" text box, briefly describe the garment
- Example: "Blue denim jacket with buttons" or "Red and white striped t-shirt"
- The description helps the AI understand the garment better

### Step 5: Advanced Settings (Optional)
- Tap "Advanced Settings" to access additional options:
  - **Quality**: More steps = better quality but slower processing
  - **Seed**: Keeps results consistent if you use the same value

### Step 6: Start Try-On
- Tap the "Start Try-On" button
- The system will process your request (this may take 30-60 seconds depending on server load)
- Results will be displayed in the "Result" area

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Image Quality**: Use clear, well-lit photos for both your portrait and the garment
2. **Positioning**: Stand straight facing the camera for your portrait
3. **Garments**: Choose garments like shirts, t-shirts, jackets, or dresses for best results
4. **Description**: Be specific in your garment description (color, style, type)
5. **Patience**: The AI processing takes time, especially on the first run

## Troubleshooting

- **Image not displaying**: Try refreshing the page or uploading a different image
- **Poor quality results**: Try increasing the quality steps in Advanced Settings
- **Processing errors**: Try a different garment or person image
- **Slow performance**: Be patient on first run as models need to load
